# DFOPriceWatcher

Project from a while back meant to help track market prices for the MMORPG Dungeon Fighter Online (DFO). Gave up on this due to DFO lacking API access. Thus, all data entry required manual input. It lasted three days before it became intolerable.

Connects to an h2 database and JavaFX GUI framework.
